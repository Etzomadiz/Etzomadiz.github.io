        <h3>Review Number 1</h3>
        <h4>The person I am reviewing is <strong>Hunter, Kepley</strong></h4>

         <ul>
           <li><strong>Style</strong> I would say the nav bar looks really good but the color scheme is very jarring to the eyes. Also the validation buttons are kinda small.</li>
           <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Has validation buttons and the site is val;id with no CSS or HTML errors.</li>
           <li><strong>Content:</strong> Content seems good and works well togther. The entire site matches which is good.</li>
           <li><strong>Fucntions:</strong> The form seems to work as expected as well as the gallery which is a plus.</li>
           <li><strong>Links:</strong> All links seem to be working.</li>
           <li><strong>Top Logo:</strong> I think the top logo is kinda faded and doesnt contrast very well on the yellow background so maybe consider changing one of the two.</li>
           <li><strong>Favacon:</strong> There is no current favacon but the page title is correct.</li>
           <li><strong>Overall Feel:</strong> I think that the page is very smooth and functions well. Accessibility wise 
            the page is very harsh on the eyes because of the color scheme but if you change that I think that the page is in really good shape.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Review Number 2</h3>

         <ul>
           <li><strong>Style</strong> Well sytle on this page is a 10 out of 10 I mean it honselty looks like a real website.</li>
           <li><strong>Validation:</strong> No validation buttons so I have no idea if the page validate.</li>
           <li><strong>Content:</strong> Content is exellent and is very clear and to the point. Information is displayed in a meaning way and easy to access.</li>
           <li><strong>Fucntions:</strong> all of the functions do work but the gallery loads very very slow which is not great.</li>
           <li><strong>Links:</strong> All links seem to be working.</li>
           <li><strong>Top Logo:</strong> the logo looks really good and fits the site perfectly.</li>
           <li><strong>Favacon:</strong> Theres is currently no favacon for the site so it would be nice to seen one.</li>
           <li><strong>Overall Feel:</strong> I think that the overall feel of the page is very very good and looks incredible. You have a few things 
        here and there to adress but once those are fixed I think its an awesome website.</li>
