        Website Evaluations
      </h2>
      <p>
       This is my evaluation of the following webistes.
      </p>
      <section>
      <h3>
          <p>
              My first website im reviewing is <a href = "https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">CraigsList</a>
          </p>
          </h3>
          <p>
              <p>
                  This site is basically used as a place where people can go to buy, sell and trade items with other people in there local area.
              </p>
              Crap Principles:
              <ul>
                  <li>Contrast: The colors are really basic by that I mean it literally just sticks to the default times new roman with whit background</li>
                  <li>Repition: The entire page repeats itself and honeslty looks really horrible.</li>
                  <li>Alignment: The alignent of the page is okay but it honestly just looks like it has no structure.</li>
                  <li>Proximity: The page is really cluttered and full of crap and is not a very user frendly experience.</li>
              </ul>
          </p><br>
          <p>
              This website is the reason the CRAP principles exist because of they did not every site would look as bad as this one does and no one would want to use the internet.
              This site deserves a 0 out of 10.
          </p>
          <h3>
          <p>
              The second website that I will be reviewing is <a href = "https://www.amazon.com//">Amazon</a>
          </p>
           </h3>
           <p>
               Amazon is a very well known site where people go to online shop for various goods ranging from TV's all the way to toothepaste.
           </p>
          <p>
              Crap Principles:
              <ul>
                  <li>Contrast: The color scheme is really good and the over look flows really well and is easy on the eyes.</li>
                  <li>Repition: The overall webiste doesn't really repeat itself and when it does its for the flow of the page.</li>
                  <li>Alignment: The page is aligned well and has a proper nav bar and header and footer which are the basic things that you need to have a good webiste.</li>
                  <li>Proximity: The webpage doesn't really have bad cluttered issues and looks pretty good spacing wise.</li>
              </ul>
          </p><br>
          <p>
            This site is a great example of what you should be doing and following when you are developing a website because it does a great job of following the CRAP principles.
            This site deserves a 9 out of 10.
