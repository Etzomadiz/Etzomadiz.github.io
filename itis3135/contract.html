          Course Contract
          <p>
            I, Seth A. LaMay agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, ITIS3135, 
            Introduction to Web App Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
            and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
            As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class itâ€™s possible to find many examples
            online or even view my classmatesâ€™ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
            and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Signed: Seth A LaMay, 02/11/2022
