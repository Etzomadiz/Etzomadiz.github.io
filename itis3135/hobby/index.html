            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The first thing that any good homeowner will need when considering a home project is a good set of tools.
            </p>
            <div>There are many different kinds of tools for many different purposes but for starting out these are the
                basic ones that all homeowners should have</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hammer:</strong> This is one of the most usefule tools in you house wether its putting in a
                    nail or knocking something loose you never want to be without one. </li>
                <li><strong>Screwdriver Set:</strong> This is another crutial tool to have in your house because you
                    never know when you are gonna need to screw or unscrew something.</li>
                <li><strong>A Saw Of Some Kind:</strong> Now you dont have to go big right away and get a table saw but
                    it is always nice to have at least a hand saw laying around in case you need to cut something.</li>
                <li><strong>Tape Measure:</strong> This is another important tool to have in your house because you want
                    to make sure whatever you are doing is very accurate. If it is not it will be very noticalbe like
                    say a picture isnt properlly centered on a wall.</li>
                <li><strong>Level:</strong> This one is my top tool that I use becuase theres nothing more upseting then
                    completeing an entire project and then realising that what you have just done is not level because
                    by that point you cannot easily fix the problem.</li>
                <li><strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
