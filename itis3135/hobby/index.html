            <h2>Tools Needed</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hammer:</strong> This is one of the most usefule tools in you house wether its putting in a
                    nail or knocking something loose you never want to be without one. </li>
                <li><strong>Screwdriver Set:</strong> This is another crutial tool to have in your house because you
                    never know when you are gonna need to screw or unscrew something.</li>
                <li><strong>A Saw Of Some Kind:</strong> Now you dont have to go big right away and get a table saw but
                    it is always nice to have at least a hand saw laying around in case you need to cut something.</li>
                <li><strong>Tape Measure:</strong> This is another important tool to have in your house because you want
                    to make sure whatever you are doing is very accurate. If it is not it will be very noticalbe like
                    say a picture isnt properlly centered on a wall.</li>
                <li><strong>Level:</strong> This one is my top tool that I use becuase theres nothing more upseting then
                    completeing an entire project and then realising that what you have just done is not level because
                    by that point you cannot easily fix the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Pliers:</strong> These are very handy for whenever you have to pull on something small and cannot grab it with your hands.</li>    
            </ul>

            <h2>Everyday Maintainence</h2>

            <p>There are a lot of things that everyone can do around their house every day that sometimes can get overlooked.
                You can start by cleaning out the filters and drains in your house. If you have an AC like 90% of homes have nowadays then you may want to
                consider changing out your air filters that are located in the massive grates in the ceiling in your house. There should be one grate per floor
                so you will need to account for that many replacments. The other very basic thing that you can clean is your drains by using a chemical like Draino
                and while you are cleaning your drains make sure to clean your faucets and showerheads because the mineral deposits can build up and cause your 
                water flow to be very poor. The last thing you want to do around your house is check all of your safety equipment which includes things like smoke 
                detectors and fire extinguishers, etc.
            </p>

            <h2>Easy Upgrades</h2>

            <p>One thing to think about when working on your house is what you can uprgrade around here to make my house look better.
                The first thing that you want to consider are litte things like a new door bell or even new door handles to 
                make the house look a little fancy.The next thing you want to consider is somthing a little bigger like your light fixtures
                and ceiling fans. Now this upgrade can be a bit expensive but the end result is worth the cost. The next thing you may want to
                consider are things like appliances because having new ones can make a huge impact on your day to day life.

            <h2>When To Call A Professional</h2>

            <p>If you don't feel confident doing a repair on your house then your best course of action is to call a professional so
                you don't make the situation worse.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaks:</strong> If your roof is ever leaking DO NOT try and fix this yourself unless you are a professional
                because you may end up making the problem worse. What you should do is turn the water off in your house and then call a plumber. </li>
                <li><strong>Roof Damage:</strong> Do not go onto your roof if you have never worked on a roof before because it is dangerous and 
                the money you think you are saving will get spent and then some when you fall off the building.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrical Issues:</strong> If it is something simple like changing a regular wall plug then maybe you can tackle that issue yourself, but
                when it comes to very strong currents it's best to leave that to the pros because you could die.</li>
            </ul>
