        <li><strong>About:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The Name of the page is "About"</li>
            <li>The purpose of this page is to give general information about the troop and to provide the user
              withcontact information and a brief history.</li>

              and then information on donations.</li>
            <li>This page is asking users if they would like to donate so it will probably have a small optional form

            <li>The page will have a submit and reset button for the donations form</li>
            <li>User will press a button and the data will be processed theoretically.</li>

      <h3>Dynamic Functionality on the website:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>My client wants there to be like a scroll feature for the photos in the gallery so I will need to impliment
          that with javascript.</li>
        <li>I will have to create a form page so that I can have user order things from the website.</li>
        <li>Im also gonna be using dynamic include for the headers and footers so I need to set that up.</li>
