          <h2><strong>Mt Crowder Hike</strong></h2>
          <div>
            <p>This event is where the girls get to go to Mt Crowder and hike to the top. There are two groups, The advanced group which 
              takes the more difficult path up the mountain and then there is the the beginner group which takes the easier path up the mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This trip allows the girls to learn how to hike and also allows them to gain an amazing experience because there is nothing quite as 
              satisfying as reaching the top of the mountain and the view isnt half bad either.
